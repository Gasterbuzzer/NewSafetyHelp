The DEBUG flag is set for a few debug prints, for a release build however they will not be shown.

Please note, a build script has been added to automatically move the built mod to the games directory, for this to work, you have to provide a textfile named "config.txt" in the top most level. 
It should contain the full absolute path to the games **Mods** folder.
