# Jumpscare Free Irritated Mind

A mod that removes all jump scares from the game.
Some scenes scripted jump scares are skipped or just removed.
This also works for the warehouse jump scares, which instead just lead to the game over screen.
Note, none of the functionality has changed, so you can still earn achievements without any issues.
